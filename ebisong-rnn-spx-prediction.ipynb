    "### Outline\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks are a special type of deep neural networks for learning outcomes where future predictions are linked to past events. The S&P 500 is a stock market index that tracks the performance of the 500 largest companies that are listed on stock exchanges in the United States. We may observe that the future price (in this case closing price) of an underlying (in this case, the S&P) may be linked to the past market data such as the previous high, low, opening and closing price of the underlying and the volume of trades made per day. Other information that affect the market in the past may also be contributing factors. In this project, we frame predicting the future closing price of the S&P 500 as a sequence problem. Hence, we use recurrent neural networks to build an approximation model for a multivariate time-series problem."
